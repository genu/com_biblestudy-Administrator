JBS_INS_STATEMENT3="Go to Components &brvbar; Joomla Bible Study. Click on the Administration menu item. There you will find a few settings you can use. Notice the Permissions/Filters tab at the top. Be sure to set the filter to no filtering of html for the user groups who will enter studies. Next click on Templates. There should be a default template listed. This is where the display settings are kept. Take some time to look through the drop downs and see how they affect the various views you set up. You can create new templates if you like. When you create menu items linking to the various view of the component you will choose which template should be accessed. If you are going to only use the default template then just choose that one (the component will default to this template if it can&#39;t find one)"
JBS_INS_STATEMENT4="2. Go back to Components | Bible Study. Click on the Servers and add your server. Remember, you are building a url that someone could paste into their browser &ndash; this isn&#39;t to your web root, but your web site address. Be sure to follow the instructions of how to put in that entry. Then go to the Folders link and add a folder under that server. Now you are set to add your first real study (be sure to delete the samples once you are familiar with how the component works)."
